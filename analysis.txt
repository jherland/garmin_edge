Analysis of bundled .fit files

2013-10-06-09-54-16.fit:
 - Relevant distances:
	Johan, python, internal: 94.618km
	Johan, python, gps-calc: 101.566km
	Johan, Garmin Connect: 94.62km
	Johan, Garmin Connect as course: 101.02km
	Amund: 101.87km
 - Bike trip in the Oslo area
 - Cadence sensor connected, provides cadence as well as distance/speed
 - According to Garmin forums, Edge 510 prefers distance data from cadence
   sensor over calculation from GPS coords
 - Friend's Garmin Forerunner 310XT recorded > 101.87km
 - My Garmin Edge 510 recorded < 94.62km
 - Follow course was enabled
 - Route calculation error
 - Occasional "Off Course" and "Course Found" alerts while riding
 - Occasional apparent freezes observed while riding
 - .fit analysis shows lots of sample gaps (3/4/5/... seconds w/o any samples)
 - 9.96% of samples missing
 - Calculating distance from GPS coords yields 101.566km, which corresponds
   much better to actual course length
 - Comparing sample-by-sample, there seems to be high correlation between
   missing samples and diff between internal distance and GPS-calc. distance.
 - Hypothesis (informed by relevant discussions on the Garmin forums): The
   "follow course" mode is buggy, and causes samples to be dropped, and also
   the internal distance to become too short.

2013-10-12-12-01-23.fit:
 - Relevant distances:
	Johan, python, internal: 12.648km
	Johan, python, gps-calc: 14.822km
	Johan, Garmin Connect: 12.65km
	Johan, Garmin Connect as course: 13.07km
	Amund: 13.71km
	Helga: 13.4km
 - Hiking trip, No biking involved.
 - Edge 510 has no hiking mode. Bike profile: "No bike"
 - No cadence sensor, distance (must?) be calculated from GPS data.
 - My Garmin Edge 510 shows considerable smaller distance than two friends'
   (Garmin) GPS devices (Forerunner 310XT and Montana 600)
 - While on trip, the difference seems to grow more quickly over the first
   kilometers. Stabilizes somewhat later in the hike.
 - 1.06% of samples missing
 - The development of the difference between internal distance and GPS-calc.
   distance seems NOT correlated with missing samples.
 - Unsure what causes the the missing samples. Maybe UI interaction?
 - Unsure why the internal distance (which is presumably calculated from
   sequence of GPS coords) is very different from (~15%) from the distance
   calculated directly from GPS coords.
 - Unsure why neither matches the distance reported by friends' GPS devices.
